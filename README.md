# -NLP-based-automated-cleansing-of-healthcare-data-

This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to develop an automated system for cleansing healthcare data. Healthcare datasets often contain inconsistencies, missing values, and unstructured text, such as clinical notes, patient records, and prescriptions. The proposed system utilizes advanced NLP tools and models to preprocess, standardize, and de identify sensitive healthcare data. It aims to improve data quality, enhance usability, and ensure 
compliance with regulatory standards.
